### Prompt 1

**Timestamp**: 2026-08-29T17:37:09Z

```text
90% Unit test Code Configuration: Add unit test configuration in this code & AI coding agents (e.g., antigravity, cursor, Claude, codex, kiro, etc.) instructions, also add 90% unit test code coverage each file wise & achieve this unit test coverage across the application. Do not skip any file. Also make sure to add a global timeout for all unit tests. Also add the configuration whenever doing any change, make sure to check for unit test coverage. Apart from just adding the configuration, please add unit tests as well to achieve this coverage. In case if per file wise unit test coverage is below 90% across any parameters such as lines, statement, branch, functions, it should throw an error. Please improve the unit test coverage & achieve the required benchmark of 90% across all parameters. In the end print the overall coverage & per file coverage without skipping any file. Do not stop till you achieve 90% unit test code coverage across all parameters each file wise.

Tech Stack upgrade to latest long term stable version, along with latest dependencies or libraries: Add a comprehensive configuration in assistant instructions to regularly audit, upgrade, and maintain all core tech stack components, runtime environments, framework dependencies, and third-party libraries to their latest Long-Term Support (LTS) or stable versions. Ensure that all breaking changes, deprecation warnings, and API updates from upgraded packages are systematically refactored across the entire codebase. Validate the upgrade by running the full test suite, linting, and typechecks to guarantee backward compatibility, operational stability, and optimal performance.

Also, Please proceed with tech stack upgradation.
```

### Prompt 6

**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T04:07:52Z

```text
Auto-resolve bugs & errors in logs: Configure assistant instructions to continuously monitor, analyze, and resolve application bugs and errors captured in log files. The system must automatically parse runtime log outputs, stack traces, and error codes to diagnose underlying issues, implement verified bug fixes, and prevent recurring failures. Validate all bug fixes through the quality check pipeline, including linting, typechecking, and test suite execution, ensuring no regressions are introduced.

Auto resolve warnings: Configure assistant instructions to automatically identify, analyze, and resolve all compiler, linter, runtime, and dependency warnings across the entire project. Ensure that the assistant proactively applies safe refactoring and fixes for deprecation notices, unused imports, type mismatches, and syntax warnings without breaking core functionality or introducing regression issues. Validate all dynamic warning fixes by running the complete quality check pipeline, including linting, typechecking, and test suites.
Auto performance optimization: Configure assistant instructions to continuously audit, identify, and apply automated performance optimizations across the entire codebase. Ensure the system proactively optimizes critical paths, implements efficient code-splitting, lazy-loading, and resource caching. Validate all performance improvements against established bundle size and latency benchmarks via the quality check pipeline.
```

### Prompt 7

**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T04:18:07Z

```text
Quality Check Configuration such as build, typecheck, lint etc: Add configuration in assistant instructions to ensure that after every change the system runs the appropriate quality check commands where AI coding agents such as antigravity, Kiro, github copilot, claude, etc will check for build issues, typecheck issues, lint issues, unit test code coverage, apply any pending database schema migrations etc. In case of multiple projects in the workspace, use global commands to check all issues in the workspace. Build & unit test coverage should be checked first. Also add a command which can check only changes in fast ways.
```

---

### Prompt 8

**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T04:26:06Z

```text
CI/CD configuration: Set up a CI/CD workflow to run on pull requests. This workflow must check for all quality requirements for the application, including linting, building, typechecking, and ensuring all unit tests pass with the required code coverage of 90% across each file across all parameters.

Also, print overall unit tests summary PR comments such as number of unit test failure or success etc, overall unit test code coverage.

Environment variables example: Add the configuration in AI coding agents (e.g., antigravity, cursor, Claude, codex, kiro, etc.) to maintain & keep an environment variables example file updated with all the required variables used in the application, ensuring no sensitive data or actual secrets are included. Add the example file as well.

In case, there is any environment variable hardcoded in codebase, please add that in env file
```

Comprehensive and Descriptive UI Error Messaging: Add a comprehensive configuration in assistant instructions to always Implement user-facing error messages that clearly present actionable context and specific failure details across different error categories.
```

---

### Prompt 10

**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T04:34:28Z

```text
Input Schema Validation: Add a comprehensive configuration in assistant instructions to enforce strict input validation across the entire application. This configuration must mandate the addition of input schema validation whenever any code change touches user or system inputs, including frontend forms, API routes, controller bodies, query parameters, and headers. Additionally, all validation schemas must be defined in dedicated constants modules, rather than being declared inline, ensuring they serve as a single source of truth for data integrity throughout the projects. Also refactor the code & apply these validation changes across the complete projects.
```

---

### Prompt 11

**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T04:38:53Z

```text
Separate constant file configuration: Add the configuration in assistant instructions to keep all constants in a separate file. Apply this configuration across the application & shift all constants to a separate file. Refactor the complete application to meet this configuration.
Types & interfaces: Add the configuration in assistant instructions to keep all data types & interfaces in a separate file. Refactor the complete application to meet this configuration.
Strictest Linter configuration: Add a comprehensive linter configuration in assistant instructions to enforce code quality, consistent formatting, and best practices across the project. The configuration should include rules to detect potential errors, ensure proper typing, and maintain a unified coding style. Ensure that linting checks are integrated into the primary build command and the CI/CD workflow to prevent code with linting errors from being committed or merged. Refactor the complete application to meet this configuration.
A. Strong Typing and Error Prevention
Strict Typing: Enforce @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any (disallow any), @typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type (require return types), @typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion (disallow !), @typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports (enforce import type), and @typescript-eslint/prefer-optional-chain.
Quality: Enforce @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars and @typescript-eslint/naming-convention (PascalCase for types/interfaces, camelCase for variables/functions).
B. React/Next.js Rules
Functional Components & Security: Enforce best practices for component hooks, dependency management, and prohibit unsafe rendering methods. Ensure consistent handling of boolean properties.
Accessibility (jsx-a11y): Enforce jsx-a11y/alt-text, jsx-a11y/no-redundant-roles, and jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid.
C. General Code Quality and Style
Maintainability: Limit complexity (max 10), max-lines (300 per file), and max-len (120 chars). Prohibit hardcoded strings via no-literal-strings to ensure UI_STRINGS usage.
Formatting & ES6+: Enforce single quotes, semi (colons), and comma-dangle. Require prefer-const, no-var, and object-shorthand.
```

### Prompt 13

**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T04:48:58Z

```text
DOM Manipulation: Add a comprehensive configuration in assistant instructions to strictly prohibit direct DOM manipulation using low-level libraries within the application framework. All UI updates must be handled through the framework's state management patterns. This ensures that the framework's view engine remains the single source of truth, preventing reconciliation issues and maintaining application performance. Refactor the complete application to ensure all existing direct DOM interactions are converted to declarative patterns.
```

### Prompt 14

**Timestamp**: 2026-08-30T04:52:48Z

```text
i18 Language internationalisation: Add a comprehensive configuration in assistant instructions to implement internationalization (i18n) across the application. Ensure that all user-facing literal strings are moved from components into dedicated constants modules, and referenced via a centralized UI_STRINGS object. This configuration must enforce that no user-facing strings & literals are hardcoded or embedded directly in the code, using template placeholders for runtime substitution to ensure the application is fully i18n-ready. Additionally, update all tests to assert against these constants instead of hardcoded text to maintain consistency and prevent brittle matches during UI changes.

Please implement the existing Buyer Profile functionality from the old repository into the new repository.

Old repositories — use these only as a reference for functionality, API flow, login/authentication, business logic, and existing Buyer Profile behavior:

Old Frontend:
`C:\Users\navin\OneDrive\Desktop\procucev\p2pui_v1`

Old Backend:
`C:\Users\navin\OneDrive\Desktop\procucev\p2pservices_v1_qua`

New repository where the functionality must be implemented:

`C:\Users\navin\OneDrive\Desktop\procucev\Enterprise_qua_nextjs`

Requirements:

1. First, carefully inspect the old frontend and backend to understand the complete Buyer Profile functionality.
2. Check how login/authentication works in the old application and identify how the Buyer Profile data is fetched, updated, validated, and saved.
3. Understand all APIs, request/response structures, validations, permissions, and business logic related to the Buyer Profile.
4. Then inspect the new `Enterprise_qua_nextjs` project and understand its current architecture, routing, API structure, state management, components, and authentication flow.
5. Re-implement the same Buyer Profile functionality in the new project using the new project's existing tech stack and coding patterns.
6. Adapt the old functionality/API integration where necessary instead of blindly copying old code, since the old and new projects use different technology stacks.
7. Preserve all existing functionality of the new project. Do not break or modify unrelated features.
8. IMPORTANT: Do NOT change the existing UI/design in the new project. Keep the current Buyer Profile UI exactly as it is.
9. Only connect the existing new UI with the required functionality, APIs, authentication, validation, and backend logic.
10. Do not copy the old UI or styling from the old repository.
11. If the new project is missing any required API/backend functionality, identify it from the old backend and implement the equivalent functionality using the new project's architecture.
12. Make sure the logged-in buyer can access and manage their own profile correctly, just like in the old application.
13. Handle loading, error, success, validation, authentication, and API failure states properly without changing the UI design.
14. After implementation, verify the complete Buyer Profile flow end-to-end and fix any TypeScript, lint, build, or runtime issues.

Before making changes, provide a short summary of:

* Old Buyer Profile flow
* Old frontend APIs/components involved
* Old backend APIs/services involved
* New project's corresponding files/components
* What needs to be implemented or connected

Then implement the changes.

IMPORTANT:
The old repositories are reference implementations only. The final implementation must follow the architecture and tech stack of `Enterprise_qua_nextjs`.

UI must remain unchanged in the new project.

Act as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer and QA Engineer.

I need to implement the Email-to-RFQ flow in the NEW Enterprise QUA application.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT change the existing registered-buyer RFQ flow.

The required behavior should be similar to the previous rfq@procucev.com email RFQ process.

==================================================
REQUIRED BUSINESS FLOW
==================================================

Incoming RFQ Email
        ↓
Enterprise QUA Email Gateway

        Send Registration Notification
                ↓
        Ask Sender to Register
                ↓
        Stop Processing

==================================================
1. REGISTERED BUYER
==================================================

If the sender email belongs to an existing authorized Enterprise QUA buyer:

Continue the existing flow exactly as it currently works.

Flow:

Email
 ↓
Sender Email
 ↓
Buyer Account Lookup
 ↓
Buyer Found / Authorized
 ↓
Existing RFQ Processing
 ↓
Gemini AI Extraction
 ↓
Category Classification
 ↓
RFQ Builder
 ↓
RFQ Creation
 ↓
Acknowledgement Email

DO NOT modify this existing business behavior.

==================================================
2. UNREGISTERED BUYER
==================================================

If the sender email does NOT belong to an existing authorized buyer:

STOP the RFQ processing.

DO NOT:

- Create a buyer account
- Create a demo buyer
- Create a temporary buyer
- Create an RFQ
- Call RFQ creation API
- Call RFQ database insertion
- Run the complete RFQ creation pipeline
- Assign the RFQ to another buyer
- Automatically authorize the sender

The email should be treated as coming from an unauthorized sender.

==================================================
3. UNAUTHORIZED BUYER NOTIFICATION
==================================================

Send an email notification to the original sender email address.

The message should clearly communicate:

"Your email address is not registered as an authorized buyer in Enterprise QUA.

Please register your buyer account in the Enterprise QUA portal and complete the required verification process.

Once your account is registered and authorized, please resend your RFQ email to the Enterprise QUA RFQ email address.

After successful registration and authorization, your RFQ can be processed."

Use the existing Enterprise QUA mailer/email service.

Do NOT create a new email infrastructure if an existing mailerService.js or email notification mechanism can be reused.

==================================================
4. EMAIL SUBJECT
==================================================

Use a clear subject similar to:

"Enterprise QUA - Buyer Registration Required"

or use the existing notification/email subject convention if one already exists.

==================================================
5. REGISTRATION LINK
==================================================

If the Enterprise QUA application already has a Buyer Portal registration URL:

Include the existing registration URL in the email.

Use the existing configuration.

Do NOT hardcode a new URL if a configured portal URL already exists.

Example:

"Please register here:
[Enterprise QUA Buyer Registration Link]"

==================================================
6. ORIGINAL RFQ EMAIL
==================================================

For an unregistered buyer:

The original email should NOT be processed into an RFQ.

If the existing email_gateway_ledger stores incoming emails, retain the email according to the existing email ledger design.

Mark it appropriately as something similar to:

UNAUTHORIZED_BUYER

or

BUYER_NOT_REGISTERED

Use the existing status enum/convention if available.

Do not invent a new status if an existing status can represent this state.

==================================================
7. DO NOT PROCESS AI FOR UNREGISTERED BUYER
==================================================

For an unauthorized sender:

Do NOT continue to:

Gemini
 ↓
Category Classification
 ↓
RFQ Builder
 ↓
RFQ Creation

The buyer authorization check must happen BEFORE the RFQ processing pipeline.

Correct:

Email
 ↓
Sender
 ↓
Buyer Authorization
 ↓
NOT AUTHORIZED
 ↓
Notification
 ↓
STOP

==================================================
8. PREVENT RFQ CREATION
==================================================

This is a critical requirement.

For an unregistered buyer, verify that none of these operations are executed:

- INSERT INTO rfqs
- RFQ POST API
- RFQ service
- RFQ creation service
- RFQ import
- RFQ builder followed by persistence
- Automatic RFQ creation

Search the entire codebase for all RFQ creation entry points.

Verify that every email-driven RFQ creation path requires an authorized buyer.

==================================================
9. EXISTING BUYER AUTHORIZATION
==================================================

Inspect the existing:

- buyer_accounts
- buyer_profiles
- authentication
- RBAC
- buyer_account_id
- buyer status
- verification status

Determine exactly what the application considers an authorized buyer.

Do NOT invent a new authorization mechanism.

Reuse the existing Enterprise QUA buyer authorization logic.

==================================================
10. DUPLICATE NOTIFICATION PROTECTION
==================================================

If the same unauthorized email is processed repeatedly by the scheduler:

Do not create multiple buyer accounts.

Do not create RFQs.

Avoid sending unnecessary duplicate registration notifications if the existing email ledger/retry mechanism already provides protection.

Reuse the existing:

email_gateway_ledger

or existing idempotency mechanism.

==================================================
11. REGISTERED BUYER REGRESSION
==================================================

After implementing the unauthorized-buyer handling, verify that registered buyers are unaffected.

Test:

REGISTERED BUYER
 ↓
Buyer Found
 ↓
Existing RFQ Flow
 ↓
RFQ Created

This must continue to work exactly as before.

==================================================
12. UNREGISTERED BUYER TEST
==================================================

Test:

UNREGISTERED EMAIL
 ↓
Buyer Not Found
 ↓
Notification Sent
 ↓
NO RFQ
 ↓
NO Buyer Created

Verify database after processing:

buyer_accounts:
NO new buyer account

rfqs:
NO new RFQ

==================================================
13. TEST CASES
==================================================

Test all of the following:

TEST 1:
Registered buyer sends valid RFQ.

Expected:
RFQ created successfully.

TEST 2:
Unregistered buyer sends valid RFQ.

Expected:
Registration notification sent.
No buyer created.
No RFQ created.

TEST 3:
Unregistered buyer sends RFQ with attachment.

Expected:
Registration notification sent.
No RFQ created.

TEST 4:
Unregistered buyer sends multiple RFQs.

Expected:
No RFQs created.
Registration notification handled using existing email/idempotency mechanism.

TEST 5:
Registered buyer sends RFQ with attachment.

Expected:
Existing attachment flow works.

TEST 6:
Registered buyer sends multiple items.

Expected:
Existing RFQ extraction/grouping works.

TEST 7:
Registered buyer sends multiple delivery locations/dates.

Expected:
Existing RFQ grouping works.

TEST 8:
AI extraction failure for registered buyer.

Expected:
Existing error handling remains unchanged.

TEST 9:
RFQ creation failure for registered buyer.

Expected:
Existing failure handling remains unchanged.

TEST 10:
Scheduler processes unauthorized email repeatedly.

Expected:
No RFQ creation and no duplicate buyer creation.

==================================================
14. EMAIL NOTIFICATION CONTENT
==================================================

Use a professional notification.

Suggested content:

Subject:
Enterprise QUA - Buyer Registration Required

Dear Sir/Madam,

We received your RFQ email, but the sender email address is not registered as an authorized buyer in Enterprise QUA.

To submit RFQs through Enterprise QUA, please register your buyer account and complete the required verification process.

Please register/login through the Enterprise QUA Buyer Portal:

[Existing Enterprise QUA Registration/Login Link]

After completing the registration and verification process, please resend your RFQ email to the Enterprise QUA RFQ email address.

Your RFQ has not been created because the sender email is currently not authorized.

Regards,
Enterprise QUA
ProcureV

Use the existing email template/style if one already exists.

==================================================
15. SECURITY REQUIREMENT
==================================================

Never assume that receiving an email makes the sender an authorized buyer.

Authorization must be based on the existing Enterprise QUA buyer account/authorization system.

Unregistered sender:

NOT AUTHORIZED
    ↓
NOT ALLOWED TO CREATE RFQ

==================================================
16. IMPLEMENTATION RESTRICTION
==================================================

Do NOT rewrite the existing Email Gateway.

Do NOT rewrite Gemini.

Do NOT rewrite RFQ creation.

Do NOT rewrite buyer registration.

Do NOT change existing Buyer Portal.

Do NOT change registered-buyer behavior.

Only add the missing unauthorized-buyer handling.

Prefer a small change in the existing email processing flow:

Email
 ↓
Find Buyer
 ↓
IF authorized
      → existing RFQ flow
ELSE
      → send registration notification
      → stop

==================================================
17. FIRST ANALYZE — DO NOT MODIFY
==================================================

Before making any code changes:

Inspect the actual Enterprise QUA code.

Find:

- emailGatewayService.js
- emailIngestionService.js
- buyer account lookup
- buyer profile services
- authentication
- email_gateway_ledger
- RFQ routes
- RFQ services
- Gemini service
- mailerService.js
- audit logging
- existing buyer registration URL/configuration

Trace the exact current flow.

Identify:

1. Where sender email is extracted.
2. Where buyer is looked up.
3. How authorized buyer is determined.
4. Where RFQ creation begins.
5. Where the best place is to stop unauthorized senders.
6. Existing email notification functionality.
7. Existing email ledger/status functionality.

DO NOT MODIFY CODE YET.

First provide:

- Current flow
- Exact files
- Exact functions
- Buyer authorization logic
- RFQ creation entry point
- Proposed minimal change
- Test plan

==================================================
18. IMPLEMENT ONLY AFTER ANALYSIS
==================================================

After the analysis:

Implement ONLY this new behavior:

UNREGISTERED BUYER
 ↓
Not Authorized
 ↓
Send Registration Notification
 ↓
Stop
 ↓
No Buyer
 ↓
No RFQ

REGISTERED BUYER
 ↓
Existing Flow
 ↓
RFQ

==================================================
19. FINAL VALIDATION
==================================================

Run:

npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:coverage
npm run build
npm run qc

Maintain the existing 90% coverage requirement.

Add tests for the new unauthorized-buyer scenario.

Final report must contain:

1. Existing flow verified
2. Unauthorized buyer flow added
3. Files modified
4. Functions modified
5. Existing services reused
6. Tests executed
7. Tests passed
8. Tests failed
9. Confirmation that no buyer is created for unauthorized senders
10. Confirmation that no RFQ is created for unauthorized senders
11. Confirmation that registered-buyer RFQ flow remains unchanged

FINAL BUSINESS RULE:

AUTHORIZED BUYER
→ PROCESS RFQ

UNAUTHORIZED / UNREGISTERED BUYER
→ SEND "PLEASE REGISTER" NOTIFICATION
→ STOP
→ NO BUYER CREATION
→ NO RFQ CREATION
```

**Timestamp**: 2026-09-16T05:14:13Z

```text
I need you to implement and test the following RFQ edge-case handling in the existing Enterprise QUA Email-to-RFQ flow.

IMPORTANT:
- First analyze the existing implementation.
- Do NOT redesign or rewrite the existing Email Gateway, buyer validation, Gemini extraction, RFQ creation, or buyer profile logic.
- Reuse existing services, APIs, database queries, validators, and helper functions wherever possible.
- Keep the existing registered-buyer and unregistered-buyer behavior unchanged.
- Make only the minimum changes required for these edge cases.
- Before modifying code, identify the exact files, functions, and current flow that need to be changed.

==================================================
REQUIRED EDGE CASES
==================================================

1. DEFAULT DELIVERY DATE = CURRENT DATE + 5 DAYS
--------------------------------------------------

If the RFQ email does NOT mention a delivery date:

- Automatically set the delivery date to:

  current date + 5 calendar days

Example:

Current date:
2026-09-16

No delivery date mentioned in email.

Expected delivery date:
2026-09-21

Rules:
- Use the server/application current date.
- Add exactly 5 calendar days.
- Do NOT hardcode the date.
- Do NOT use the email received date if the application has a more appropriate current-date utility.
- Reuse the existing date utility/service if one already exists.
- Preserve the existing date format expected by the RFQ API/database.
- If the email explicitly provides a delivery date, ALWAYS use the email-provided date instead of the default +5 days.
- Do not overwrite a valid extracted delivery date.

Examples:

Email:
"Please provide quotation for 10 laptops."

Expected:
delivery_date = current_date + 5 days

Email:
"Required by 25 September 2026."

Expected:
delivery_date = 2026-09-25

==================================================
2. DEFAULT DELIVERY LOCATION FROM BUYER REGISTRATION
==================================================

If the RFQ email does NOT mention delivery location:

- Fetch the registered buyer's default delivery location from the existing Buyer Profile / Buyer Account data.
- Use that registered location for the RFQ.

The location may contain:

- City
- State
- Pincode

Example buyer registration:

City: Bangalore
State: Karnataka
Pincode: 560001

Email:
"Please provide quotation for 20 laptops."

Expected RFQ:

delivery_city = Bangalore
delivery_state = Karnataka
delivery_pincode = 560001

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT hardcode Bangalore, Karnataka, or any other location.
- Fetch the location dynamically from the authenticated/validated buyer's registration/profile.
- Reuse the existing buyer profile/account service.
- Do not create another buyer lookup implementation if an existing service already provides buyer details.

==================================================
3. PARTIAL LOCATION HANDLING
==================================================

Do NOT blindly replace partial location information with the buyer's default location.

If the email provides only some location fields, preserve the provided fields and use the buyer registration location only for the missing fields IF the existing business rules support this behavior.

Examples:

Buyer registration:
City: Bangalore
State: Karnataka
Pincode: 560001

Email:
"Delivery location: Pune"

Expected:
delivery_city = Pune

Do not replace Pune with Bangalore.

If the application/business rule requires state/pincode to remain empty when they are not explicitly available, preserve that existing behavior.

Before implementing partial-location fallback, inspect the existing location-handling logic and maintain its established behavior.

==================================================
4. MULTIPLE LINE ITEMS
==================================================

The system must support multiple line items in a single RFQ.

Maximum:
49 line items per RFQ.

Example email:

1. Dell Latitude Laptop - 10 Nos
2. HP Laser Printer - 5 Nos
3. Logitech Keyboard - 20 Nos
4. Dell Mouse - 20 Nos
...
49. Item

Expected:

ONE RFQ containing all 49 line items when:

- Delivery date is the same
- Delivery location is the same

Do NOT create 49 separate RFQs.

The RFQ should contain all applicable line items according to the existing RFQ data model/API.

==================================================
5. GROUPING RULE FOR MULTIPLE ITEMS
==================================================

Multiple line items should be grouped into the SAME RFQ when they have:

- Same delivery date
AND
- Same delivery location

Conceptually:

RFQ Group Key:

(delivery_date + delivery_city + delivery_state + delivery_pincode)

Example:

Item 1:
Laptop
Date: 2026-09-21
Location: Bangalore

Item 2:
Monitor
Date: 2026-09-21
Location: Bangalore

Item 3:
Keyboard
Date: 2026-09-21
Location: Bangalore

Expected:

ONE RFQ

with 3 line items.

==================================================
6. DIFFERENT DATE / LOCATION
==================================================

If line items have different delivery dates or locations, follow the existing grouping/business logic.

Example:

Item 1:
Laptop
Date: 2026-09-21
Location: Bangalore

Item 2:
Printer
Date: 2026-09-25
Location: Bangalore

Expected:
Separate RFQ groups because delivery dates differ.

Another example:

Item 1:
Laptop
Date: 2026-09-21
Location: Bangalore

Item 2:
Printer
Date: 2026-09-21
Location: Hyderabad

Expected:
Separate RFQ groups because delivery locations differ.

==================================================
7. DEFAULT DATE + DEFAULT LOCATION + MULTIPLE ITEMS
==================================================

Test the combined edge case.

Email:

"Dear Team,

Please provide quotation for the following:

1. Dell Latitude Laptop - 10 Nos
2. HP Laptop - 15 Nos
3. Dell Monitor - 20 Nos
4. Logitech Keyboard - 25 Nos

Please send your quotation.

Regards,
Buyer"

No delivery date mentioned.
No delivery location mentioned.

Buyer registration:

City: Bangalore
State: Karnataka
Pincode: 560001

Current date:
2026-09-16

Expected:

delivery_date:
2026-09-21

delivery_location:
Bangalore, Karnataka, 560001

Expected:
ONE RFQ containing all 4 line items.

==================================================
8. 49-ITEM BOUNDARY TEST
==================================================

Create a test case containing exactly 49 valid line items.

Expected:
- One RFQ.
- All 49 items preserved.
- No item lost.
- No duplicate item.
- No truncation.
- No second RFQ created merely because there are 49 items.
- Quantities must remain correct.
- Item descriptions/specifications/brand/UOM must remain correctly mapped where available.

Then test:

50 line items.

Do NOT automatically assume what should happen for 50 items.

First inspect the existing RFQ API/data-model limitation and validation rules.

If the application explicitly supports a maximum of 49 items:
- enforce the existing limit consistently;
- return a clear validation message;
- do not silently lose item #50;
- do not silently create an incorrect RFQ.

If the existing system has a batching mechanism for >49 items, reuse it rather than introducing a new behavior.

==================================================
9. AI EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Inspect the existing Gemini extraction prompt/schema.

Ensure Gemini can return multiple line items rather than only one item.

The extracted structure should support something conceptually similar to:

{
  "items": [
    {
      "item_description": "...",
      "specifications": "...",
      "quantity": 10,
      "uom": "Nos",
      "brand": "Dell",
      "delivery_date": null,
      "delivery_city": null,
      "delivery_state": null,
      "delivery_pincode": null
    },
    {
      "item_description": "...",
      "specifications": "...",
      "quantity": 5,
      "uom": "Nos",
      "brand": "HP",
      "delivery_date": null,
      "delivery_city": null,
      "delivery_state": null,
      "delivery_pincode": null
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Adapt this structure to the actual existing Enterprise QUA implementation.
- Do NOT blindly replace the current Gemini schema.
- Preserve compatibility with existing RFQ creation code.
- Validate Gemini output before sending it to the RFQ API.

==================================================
10. APPLY DEFAULTS AFTER AI EXTRACTION
==================================================

Preferred processing order:

Email
  ↓
Registered Buyer Validation
  ↓
Existing Email Parsing
  ↓
Gemini Extraction
  ↓
Validate Extracted Items
  ↓
Apply Default Delivery Date if missing
  ↓
Apply Buyer Default Location if missing
  ↓
Group Items by Date + Location
  ↓
Validate Maximum 49 Items per RFQ
  ↓
Build RFQ Request
  ↓
Existing RFQ Creation API
  ↓
Existing Acknowledgement Flow

IMPORTANT:

Do NOT put the +5 day default or buyer-location fallback inside Gemini.

These are deterministic business rules and should be handled by application logic after extraction.

==================================================
11. REGISTERED BUYER FLOW
==================================================

For an authorized/registered buyer:

Continue the existing RFQ flow.

Only apply:

- Default date = current date + 5 days when delivery date is missing.
- Default location = buyer registration location when delivery location is missing.
- Multiple-line-item handling.
- Maximum 49-item validation.

Do not change any other existing behavior.

==================================================
12. UNREGISTERED BUYER FLOW
==================================================

Do NOT change the existing unauthorized-buyer requirement.

If the sender is not an authorized Enterprise QUA buyer:

- Send the existing registration-required notification.
- Do NOT create a buyer.
- Do NOT create a demo buyer.
- Do NOT run Gemini extraction unnecessarily.
- Do NOT create an RFQ.
- Stop processing.

The +5 day/default-location logic applies ONLY after buyer authorization succeeds.

==================================================
13. DUPLICATE / SCHEDULER SAFETY
==================================================

The existing email scheduler may process emails repeatedly.

Ensure these changes do not create duplicate RFQs.

Reuse the existing:

- email_gateway_ledger
- message ID tracking
- processed status
- idempotency logic
- duplicate detection

Do NOT create a new duplicate-prevention system if one already exists.

==================================================
14. VALIDATION
==================================================

Validate before RFQ creation:

- At least one valid line item exists.
- Quantity is valid.
- Item description is valid.
- Delivery date is valid after applying the default.
- Delivery location is valid according to existing business rules.
- Maximum 49 items per RFQ is respected.
- No line item is silently dropped.
- No duplicate line item is unintentionally created.

==================================================
15. TEST CASES
==================================================

Add/update automated tests for at least these cases:

TEST 1:
Single item + date provided + location provided.

Expected:
Use email date and email location.

TEST 2:
Single item + date missing + location provided.

Expected:
Date = current date + 5 days.

TEST 3:
Single item + date provided + location missing.

Expected:
Location = buyer registration default location.

TEST 4:
Single item + date missing + location missing.

Expected:
Date = current date + 5 days.
Location = buyer registration default location.

TEST 5:
5 items + same date + same location.

Expected:
1 RFQ with 5 line items.

TEST 6:
49 items + same date + same location.

Expected:
1 RFQ with exactly 49 line items.

TEST 7:
Multiple items + different dates.

Expected:
Existing grouping behavior must be respected.

TEST 8:
Multiple items + different locations.

Expected:
Existing grouping behavior must be respected.

TEST 9:
49 items + missing date + missing location.

Expected:
All 49 items use:
date = current date + 5 days
location = buyer registration default location

Expected:
1 RFQ with 49 items.

TEST 10:
50 items.

Expected:
Follow the existing 49-item limit/business validation.
No silent data loss.

TEST 11:
Unregistered buyer.

Expected:
Registration notification.
No Gemini processing.
No RFQ creation.

TEST 12:
Same email processed twice.

Expected:
No duplicate RFQ.

==================================================
16. IMPORTANT CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

Before coding:

1. Trace the complete current email-to-RFQ flow.
2. Identify:
   - emailGatewayService.js
   - emailIngestionService.js
   - geminiService.js
   - buyer account/profile service
   - RFQ service/controller
   - email_gateway_ledger handling
   - relevant validators
   - relevant tests
3. Show the exact files/functions that need modification.
4. Explain how the current system handles:
   - delivery date
   - delivery location
   - multiple line items
   - RFQ grouping
   - maximum item count
5. Then implement the minimum required changes.

Do NOT:
- rewrite existing services
- create duplicate APIs
- create duplicate buyer lookup logic
- create a new RFQ creation mechanism
- hardcode buyer location
- hardcode dates
- put business defaults inside Gemini
- change registered/unauthorized buyer behavior unnecessarily

==================================================
17. QUALITY GATES
==================================================

After implementation run the project's existing verification commands, such as:

npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:coverage
npm run build
npm run qc

Use the actual scripts available in package.json.

Maintain the project's existing minimum 90% coverage requirement.

If any test fails:
- identify the root cause;
- fix it without weakening existing tests;
- rerun the relevant tests.

==================================================
FINAL REPORT
==================================================

After implementation, provide:

1. Files modified
2. Functions modified
3. Default date logic implemented
4. Default buyer-location logic implemented
5. Multiple-line-item handling
6. 49-item validation behavior
7. Grouping behavior
8. Test cases added/updated
9. Test results
10. Build/QC results
11. Any assumptions or limitations

Do not make unrelated changes.

logs: Comparison generation from system received quote and email received quote when a vendor revert back in the mail, the bid should be reflected in the system
Implement/fix the Vendor Comparison functionality in Enterprise QUA so that quotations received through both the Web Portal and Email are reflected correctly in the same Vendor Comparison.

Current requirement:
In Enterprise QUA, there is a Vendor Comparison section where buyers can compare vendor quotations. Currently, a vendor can submit a quote through the portal, but when the same vendor responds to the RFQ through email, the email-received quotation/bid should also be captured and displayed in the Vendor Comparison on the web portal.

Expected flow:
1. Buyer creates an RFQ and sends it to vendors.
2. Vendor can submit a quotation through the Enterprise QUA web portal.
3. Vendor can also respond to the RFQ through email with their quotation/bid details.
4. When the vendor replies by email, the email service should identify the correct RFQ and vendor, extract the quotation/bid information, validate it, and save it in the same quotation/bid data structure used by the portal quotation flow.
5. The email quotation must then appear in Enterprise QUA → Vendor Comparison along with quotations submitted through the web portal.
6. If the same vendor has already submitted a portal quotation and later sends an email quotation for the same RFQ, do not create an incorrect duplicate vendor entry. Follow the existing business logic for whether the email quote should update/replace the existing quote or be stored as a separate revision. Preserve quotation history if the application already supports revisions.
7. Vendor identification must be reliable using the vendor's registered email/vendor ID and the RFQ ID/reference present in the email.
8. The RFQ ID must be mapped correctly even when the vendor's email reply is part of an existing email thread. Handle subject/body/reference variations without breaking the mapping.
9. Extract all relevant quotation fields supported by the existing quotation model, such as item/line item, quoted quantity, unit price, total price, taxes, delivery charges, delivery date, payment terms, warranty, quotation validity, remarks, and any other existing quotation fields.
10. For multi-line-item RFQs, correctly map each quoted item to the corresponding RFQ line item. Do not merge different items or assign values to the wrong line item.
11. After successful email processing, the quotation should be available through the existing quotation APIs and should automatically appear in the Vendor Comparison UI without requiring a separate/manual entry.
12. The Vendor Comparison should clearly indicate the quotation source where the application already supports source information, for example Portal/Web vs Email, but do not break the existing UI design.

Please investigate the existing implementation before making changes. Trace the complete flow:
Email inbox → email reader/service → RFQ identification → vendor identification → AI/extraction logic → quotation payload → quotation database/service → quotation API → Vendor Comparison backend → Vendor Comparison frontend.

Check both backend and frontend and identify where the email quotation is currently being lost or not connected to Vendor Comparison.

Important:
- Reuse the existing quotation/vendor/RFQ models, APIs, services, database tables, and business logic wherever possible.
- Do not create a parallel quotation system just for email.
- Ensure portal quotations continue working exactly as before.
- Ensure email quotations are persisted reliably and are returned by the same Vendor Comparison API/data source used by portal quotations.
- Add appropriate logging for RFQ ID, vendor ID/email, quotation source, extraction result, database save/update result, and comparison retrieval.
- Handle invalid RFQ IDs, unknown vendors, missing quotation values, malformed emails, duplicate emails, and partially extracted quotations gracefully.
- Do not hardcode vendor IDs, RFQ IDs, email addresses, prices, or quotation values.
- Verify database persistence and API responses.
- Test with:
  A. One RFQ + one vendor quote through portal.
  B. One RFQ + one vendor quote through email.
  C. One RFQ + multiple vendors, where some quote through portal and others through email.
  D. Same vendor quoting through portal and then email.
  E. RFQ with multiple line items where the vendor quotes all items through email.
  F. Vendor email reply using the existing email thread.
  G. Invalid/unknown RFQ or vendor email.

Acceptance criteria:
- A quotation submitted through the portal appears in Vendor Comparison.
- A quotation received through email appears in the same Vendor Comparison.
- Portal and email quotations can be compared together for the same RFQ.
- Vendor and RFQ mapping is correct.
- Multi-line-item quotations are mapped correctly.
- Duplicate/repeated email processing does not create unintended duplicate bids.
- Existing portal quotation functionality is not broken.
- Backend API response contains the email-received quotation.
- Frontend Vendor Comparison displays the email quotation without requiring manual refresh/data entry beyond the existing refresh behavior.
- Provide a concise summary of the root cause, files changed, database/API changes, and test results after implementation.
