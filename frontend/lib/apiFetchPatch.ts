/**
 * Rewrites relative `/api/*` fetch() calls to an absolute backend origin,
 * client-side only, when NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL is set.
 *
 * On Node/Render, that env var is unset, so this is a no-op and every call
 * stays relative, going through next.config.mjs's server-side rewrite as
 * before.
 *
 * On Cloudflare, the frontend and backend are two separate Workers on the
 * same zone (workers.dev), and Cloudflare does not let one Worker fetch()
 * another Worker on the same zone without a Service Binding —
 * https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/#worker-to-worker-communication.
 * next.config.mjs's rewrite is exactly that kind of same-zone Worker-to-Worker
 * fetch under the hood (vinext's external-rewrite proxy), so it 403s there
 * with Cloudflare's "Direct IP access not allowed" page — confirmed live
 * against the deployed Workers. The browser calling the backend directly is
 * an ordinary cross-origin fetch, not Worker-to-Worker, and isn't subject to
 * that restriction; the backend already sends permissive CORS (see
 * backend/src/app.js's `app.use(cors())`). Patching the one global `fetch`
 * here, once, avoids touching the ~20 call sites across lib/*.ts and
 * app/**\/*.tsx that call `fetch('/api/...')` directly.
