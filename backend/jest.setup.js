// `pool.js`'s resolveConfig() treats an empty string exactly like "unset"
// (`env.DATABASE_URL || ''`), so a query is refused outright rather than
// reaching the real database. Tests that specifically exercise pool/migrate/view
// CLI logic (pool.test.js, migrate.test.js, view.test.js,

// exercise the Gmail API branch instead of the IMAP configuration/fault
// logic they were actually written to test — 32 failures the moment
// pollOnce/isConfigured/describeConfigurationFault started checking
// isGmailApiConfigured() first. Tests that specifically exercise the Gmail
// API path (mailerService.test.js, emailGateway.test.js's own
// pollViaGmailApi describe block) set their own values per test via
// jest.isolateModules, which overrides this default within that scope and

// test runs goes out over the network to the REAL database instead of
// safely no-op'ing — confirmed live: correcting a stale, wrong

// authService resolves this once at module load. Without it, a non-production
// process generates a random key, which is correct behaviour but leaves the suite
// unable to sign a token itself — and the tests that build deliberately malformed
// tokens have to produce a valid signature first in order to reach the payload
// checks at all.
//
// It used to work because authService shipped a hardcoded fallback secret and
// three tests re-signed with that literal. That literal is gone: it meant the
// signing key for any deployment that forgot to set AUTH_SECRET was sitting in
// the repository. Pinning it here is the test-side replacement.
