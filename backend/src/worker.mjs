// Node/Render entry point this parallels — that one stays the source of
// truth for local dev and the current Render deploy; this file is additive.

// "Dynamic require of 'cloudflare:workers' is not supported" — the bundler

// is the only file in the backend that's real ESM. Every D1-ported query
// silently fell back to the pg pool because of this (queryD1 never ran; only
// the try/catch in getD1Binding swallowing the throw). Stashing the binding
// on globalThis here, once, lets d1Bridge.js read it synchronously without

// where the process just keeps running — but on Workers, once the response
// has been sent, an unawaited promise not passed to ctx.waitUntil() can be
// cancelled before it finishes, dropping the write entirely (confirmed live:
// a created RFQ never made it into D1). `waitUntil` imported here from
// cloudflare:workers works the same as ctx.waitUntil() but from anywhere,
// without threading `ctx` through Express — stashed on globalThis for the
